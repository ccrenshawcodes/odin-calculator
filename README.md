Create a functioning calculator.

Should:
    - have a working UI
    - Add, subtract, divide, and multiply
    - only compare two numbers at once (eg 7 + 2 - 3 should evaluate 7 + 2 and display 9 when the - button is pressed; then evaluate 9 - 3)
    - have a 'clear' button
    - give a (snarky) error if the user tries to divide by 0
